# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on objects and classes. It helps in organizing code in a modular way, making it reusable and scalable.

## Key Concepts
- **Classes and Objects**  
- **Encapsulation**  
- **Inheritance**  
- **Polymorphism**  
- **Abstraction**  

## Topics to Learn
- Defining classes and creating objects  
- Using constructors and destructors  
- Implementing inheritance and method overriding  
- Understanding encapsulation with access specifiers  
- Implementing polymorphism in Python
